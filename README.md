# NLP-classification-on-full-length-news-articles-ISOT-
An NLP text-classification benchmark for detecting fake news from full-length articles (title + body). This content-only approach avoids social/network data to create a fair, deployable baseline that isolates textual veracity signals from contextual bias, outputting a binary fake (0) or real (1) label.
